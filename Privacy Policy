1. Sharing data

We never share your data with anyone. No.

2. Storing data

Wheresapp only stores the data it needs to function properly â€” for as long as you want Wheresapp to function.

Ordinary Messages
Wheresapp is a cloud service. We store data from your ordinary calls on our servers.

Contacts
Wheresapp uses phone numbers as unique identifiers, so that it is easy for you to switch from other messaging apps (SMS, WhatsApp, etc.) and retain your social graph.

We store your contacts in order to notify you as soon as one of your contacts signs up for Wheresapp.

3. Deleting data

Accounts
If you would like to delete your account, you can do this on the deactivation page. Deleting your account permanently removes all your data, and contacts. This action must be confirmed via your Wheresapp account and cannot be undone.
